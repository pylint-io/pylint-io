# This is an example secrets file.
# Copy this to secrets.yml (which is is ignored by git) and edit
# as appropriate.
#
# all secrets for pylint.io are stored here, i.e. database.yml
# references values stored here

# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can use `rails secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# Shared secrets are available across all environments.
